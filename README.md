# Pre-work - *Prework*

**Prework** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Chau Ho**

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Implement dark mode for the app
- [x] User can choose the tip percentage by either tapping different values on the segmented control or using the slider below it and the tip value is updated accordingly
- [x] User can choose to split the bill by 1 or 2 or 3 or 4, then choose the tip percentage again and the tip value is updated accordingly
- [x] User can choose to convert the bill's currency (default currency is in US Dollar) either to Canadian Dollar or Australian Dollar by tapping different currency types on the segmented control.

## Notes

This is the first time that I learn how to create an IOS application by using Swift language via Xcode; there are several challenges that I encountered while building this app. The biggest challenge was to figure out how to let the user use both different tip percentage values on the segmented control and the slider. Also, I use the currency rate as of February 27th, 2021 for this application.
